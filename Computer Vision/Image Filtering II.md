## How to describe filtering mathematically?
- Signal processing  
- Filtering as convolution

**For 1D**

Or more abstractly:

## Filtering in signal processing
- Filtering is studies in depth in signal processing, which:
	- removes unwanted components/features from signals
	- enhances desired features
It can be done on a hardware device (eg guitar pedals) or via software (eg Garageband)

**Filtering can be done on arbitrary dimension signals; from audio to radar imagery**

## Impulse response
Impulse response is the output of a filter when the input is an impulse signal

For continuous signal, an impulse is a Dirac delta function $\delta (x)$

For discrete signal, it is a Kronecker delta function $\delta[x]$

- The impulse response h completely characterises a linear time-invariant filter. As along as we know h, we can calculate the output signal ùë¶, given any input ùë•.
- In signal processing, we often denote a filter by its impulse response function h.

## Time-invariant system
Most filters we've seen thus far are **linear** and **time-invariant**.

As we can see; if the same input is given at different times, the output is the same, just offset by time elapsed. *Time elapsed offset must be the same; time offsets MUST be propagated from input to output.*
- $g[n] = 10 \cdot f[n]$ is time-invariant, amplifies input by constant step
- $g[n] = n \cdot [n]$ is not time-invariant, output depends on time step n

## Linear systems
![[Pasted image 20240118094619.png]]
- if a system is linear, combining two inputs linearly leads to the output being combined linearly:
	$output(\alpha f_{1[n]} + \beta f_{2[n]}= \alpha g_{1[n]} + \beta g_2[n] )$
## Linear, time-invariant systems
- Theory and methods are well developed for linear time-invariant systems.
- For such systems, impulse response $h$ completely characterises how the system works.
- Thus given input $f$ and impulse response $h$; we can derive $g$ and define this output as a *convolution.*

We know $f$ and $h$ so we can uniquely characterise $g$

**Thus convolution is defined as:**

**Commutativity**
![[Pasted image 20240122090952.png]]
This can clearly be shown via substitution of variables (let $k = n - m$, ‚Ä¶)

## Example of convolution
![[Pasted image 20240122091102.png]]
This is a simple moving average of a vector of dimension 3

**Implementation**
![[Pasted image 20240122091235.png]]
Inputs always in ascending order, so in order to compute, we first *flip* the impulse response, then multiply to get $g$. We then shift for the next entry $g[n + 1]$. Inspect the formula to understand the need to flip. TODO: EXPAND

## 2D Convolution
Thus far we have only looked at 1D; we are not sound engineers so let's move onto 2D.

From [[Image Filtering I]], we know for a moving average we do:
![[Pasted image 20240122092131.png]]

This can be expressed mathematically as:
![[Pasted image 20240122092154.png]]
Which can be rewritten as:
![[Pasted image 20240122092208.png]]
Applied:
![[Pasted image 20240122092510.png]]
First we flip:
![[Pasted image 20240122092538.png]]
Then we multiply and sum:
![[Pasted image 20240122092556.png]]
Before we shift and repeat.

**Associativity**

![[Pasted image 20240122092823.png]]

We used this earlier to improve the complexity of average: (TODO: DO IN CW)
