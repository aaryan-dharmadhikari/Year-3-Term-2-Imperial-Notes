1. **Initial Guess at Scale l**: To start the estimation at a given scale 'l', the method first upsamples (increases the resolution of) the flow estimate from the next coarser scale 'l+1'. This upsampled flow field is then doubled to serve as the initial guess for the current scale.
2. **Compute the Warped Image**: The algorithm warps the second image $J^l$ according to the initial flow guess $u^l,v^l$ to bring it closer to the first image $I^l$. Warping modifies the second image so that it is as if it has been taken from the same viewpoint as the first image.
3. **Compute Image Gradients**: The spatial gradients $I_x,I_y$​ and the temporal gradient $I_t$​ are computed. The spatial gradients are the derivatives of the image intensities in the x and y directions, and the temporal gradient is the derivative of the image intensity over time, which is approximated as the difference in intensity between the warped second image and the first image.
4. **Estimate Incremental Flow**: The incremental flow $[u^δ,v^δ]$ is calculated by solving the system of equations derived from the optical flow constraint equation, which can be represented in $A^TAδ=A^Tb$. This is a least squares problem where $A$ is the matrix of gradient values and  $b$ is the image intensity differences.
6. **Update the Flow**: Finally, the flow at the current scale is updated by adding the incremental flow to the initial guess.
