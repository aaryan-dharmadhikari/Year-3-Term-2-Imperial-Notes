- ASAP needed one cycle of buffering to schedule the graph, but ALAP requires none. Since thereâ€™s only a finite number of buffers on the FPGA, this is a better result.
### What if we add another output?

 - neither can schedule optimally.
- Note that in this design, the optimal schedule would have no buffering, since we can push the buffer next to output zero into the output (stream inputs and outputs are implemented by memory buffers, so this is equivalent to changing the address to that buffer by a small, constant amount).

Ruby pipelining does resemble Maxeler scheduling, with some differences: 
- Ruby is top-down (add parameters to design description), whereas Maxeler is bottom-up (annotate the graph after building). 
- Ruby operators are all combinatorial, whereas Maxeler operators are pipelined by default (see Maxeler loop lecture). 
- Ruby allows you to control pipelining using clustering, whereas Maxeler uses another API call (see loop lecture).
